Suppose you are the inventor of a social network (call it Fussbook). The attached file, net-
work_fussbook.txt, describes the friendships between individuals on Fussbook. Assume that all
relationships are symmetric, i.e., the graph is undirected.

(a) Write a small program that takes a filename as input, opens and parses the file, and outputs
the number of nodes and edges in the network.

(b) Suppose you are tasked with finding the “most well-connected” person on Fussbook. In
your view, which concept from graph theory (discussed in class) is a plausible measure of
well-connectedness?

(c) Write another small program that automatically determines the most well-connected person in
Fussbook.

Repeat parts a and c for a rival social network (call it Instaface); a description of friend
relationships on this network is given in network_instaface.txt.
