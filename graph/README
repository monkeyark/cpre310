To run this program. Open a termnial and use command [make] to compile, the executable is named as [graph.cpp]

run the executable binary, then input the name of the file you want to parse in to the program.
input file need to be in strict format of "int string string string int" in every line.

program output will be displayed in termnial.


/*
Suppose you are the inventor of a social network (call it Fussbook). The attached file, net-
work_fussbook.txt, describes the friendships between individuals on Fussbook. Assume that all
relationships are symmetric, i.e., the graph is undirected.

(a) Write a small program that takes a filename as input, opens and parses the file, and outputs
the number of nodes and edges in the network.

(b) Suppose you are tasked with finding the “most well-connected” person on Fussbook. In
your view, which concept from graph theory (discussed in class) is a plausible measure of
well-connectedness?

(c) Write another small program that automatically determines the most well-connected person in
Fussbook.

Repeat parts a and c for a rival social network (call it Instaface); a description of friend
relationships on this network is given in network_instaface.txt.
